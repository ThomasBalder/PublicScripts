This folder contains some scripts to implement Microsoft's TIER model (also known as ESAE).
Orignal scripts are from:
- Technet (used the wayback machine for this: http://web.archive.org/web/20201214180026/https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/windowsserverdocs/blob/master/WindowsServerDocs/identity/securing-privileged-access/privileged-access-workstations.md) 
- Azureblog: https://www.azureblog.pl/2020/04/13/deploying-tiering/

Please check each script carefully for all the options you may or not want (or correctness of OU's).
