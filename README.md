# PublicScripts
My public script repo. Stuff that I tested and generalized for you to use. Mostly Powershell scripts, and grouped by folder for function/use.
Some dual-purpose scripts (i.e. user creation incl. Office 365) might be in a folder where they're first used (i.e. AD local).

Scripts that someone else wrote will be given credit for in the script.
