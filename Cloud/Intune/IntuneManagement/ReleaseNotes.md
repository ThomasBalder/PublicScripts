- **Batch Export of App Content Encryption Key from Intunewin files**<br />
  This script can export encryption keys from existing intunewin files<br />
  Example:<br />
  Export-EncrytionKeys -RootFolder C:\Intune\Packages -ExportFolder C:\Intune\Download<br />
  This will export the encryption key information for each .intunewinfiles under C:\Intune\Packages<br />
  One json file will be created (for each .intunwinfile) in the C:\Intune\Download folder<br />
  File name will be **<*IntunewinFileBaseName*>_<*UnencryptedFileSize*>.json**<br />
  Do **NOT** rename this file since the script will search for that file when downloading or exporting App content<br />
  The script will not require authentication and it will have no knowledge of apps in Intune<br />
  Filename and unencrypted file size is used as the identifier to match app content in Intune with encryption file<br />
  **Important notes:**<br /> 
  Exported and decrypted .intunewin files are not supported to use for import at the moment.<br />
  These files are just the "zip" version of the source and can be unzipped with any zip extraction tool<br />
  The .intunewin file used for import has the "zip" version of the file and an xml with the encryption information +<br />
  additional file information eg. msi properties, file size etc.<br />
  Use the exported unencrypted "zip" version to restore the original files. Re-run the packaging tool if it should be re-used as applications content<br />
  <br />
  Please report any issues or create a discussion if there are any questions<br />
  Script is located: **<*RootFolder*>\Scripts\Export-EncrytionKeys.ps1**<br />

    Note: Some values will NOT be included. These are referenced values and not a property on the object eg Certificate on a VPN profile, Root certificate on a SCEP profile etc. These values will be documented with ##TBD...<br />

    This is based on [Issue 37](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/37)

  - Support for attaching the json file for the object in the word document

  - Support for documentation output level (Word)<br />
    Documenting the full environment can create a document with 1000+ pages depending on the amount of profiles and policies. The documentation output level can now be used to reduce the document size. The output level options are:

    - Full - Document every single value
    - Limited - Set max value and truncate size for documentation and as option, attach the original value as a text document to the value cell e.g. truncate all values over 500 characters to 10 characters and attach the full value as a text file in the document. This will reduce documentation size for profiles with large XML strings like ADMX ingestion
    - Basic - Only include the Basic and Assignments tables in the documentation 

  - Added support for documenting Filters

- Added UI for configuring custom columns<br />
  This can now be done in the Detail View<br />

  Thank you Jason!

## 3.3.2  - 2021-12-14

**New features**

- Markdown support for documentation (Experimental)
  This will create a MD document in the Documents folder.
  **Note:** This is not working 100% at the moment. The script will create a MD document but it might be too large if all objects in the environment are documented. 

  Also note that HTML tables are used so that code can be documented as code blocks. This must be supported by the MD Viewer. The *Markdown Viewer* extension in Chrome was used during testing.

  Please report any suggestions to the issue.<br />
  This is based on [Issue 35](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/35)

- Added support for batched export

  The separate settings file was not exported with the ID in the name which could cause issues during import

## 3.3.1 (Beta) - 2021-10-28

This is a **BETA** release. It contains core changes for Authentication and Settings management. Please report any issues [here](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues).

**New features**

- Added support for selecting GCC when using US Government Cloud

- Tenant Specific Setting
  
  The script now supports tenant specific settings. This can be used in scenarios like: only allow delete on you test environments, tenant specific Intune app folders etc.
  Login settings like Cloud and GCC is only used if logging on with a cached token. It will otherwise use the current tenant settings. 

  **Test feedback request:** If there are any users accessing multiple cloud environments like US Government with different GCC levels, please report any issues, working or not. Please report it to [Issue 26](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/26)

  Note: Not all settings have be tested and verified and only Setting Values are supported e.g. last Bulk Compare strings are global. Cached settings might not be updated when connecting to another tenant.   
  
- Log View 
  
  View the log of the current session in the app
  
- Added support for documenting scripts for Word
  This is based on [Issue 34](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/34)

- Permission detection if **Use Default Permissions** is enabled
  
  Default permissions will only use the permission consented to the selected Azure App. The script will check the required permissions with the Access Token. If permissions are missing for one or more objects, they will be marked as red in the menu or they can be excluded from the menu by enable **Hide No-access items** in Settings 

**Default Settings Value Changes**

* **Use Default Permissions** is now set to Enabled by default. With the Tenant Specific Settings feature, this can now be enabled globally or per tenant. Consultants accessing multiple environments might not have permissions to grant consent requests so this could be enabled on a global level and then disabled for tenants where the permissions can be added.  

**Fixes**

* Fixed an issue when using Json settings where it could not add child settings  

## 3.3.0 (Beta) - 2021-10-17

- Bulk Compare for exported folders

  The tool can now compare two exported folders 
  This is based on [Issue 32](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/32)

- Support for Azure AD US Government cloud and Azure AD China cloud. Default is Azure AD Public cloud. 

  Change cloud in Settings
  **Note:** This is a major change to the authentication. This may have an impact if a custom configured Azure app is used.
  This is based on [Issue 26](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/26). Please report any problem, progress or testing with US Government/China cloud or if there are any issues when a custom configured Azure app is used. 

- Export can now add Id to the name of the backup file

  This can be used if there are multiple objects with the same name.

  This can be enabled in Settings. Backup file name will be <Name>_<Id>.json.

  This is based on [Issue 27](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/27)

- All objects are returned

  This might take long time in huge environments. 
  Please report feedback on how this works in environments with 1000+ objects e.g. does it take too long time, memory issues etc.
  This is based on [Issue 29](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/29)

- Added support for custom columns
  This must be manually added to the registry.

  See [Readme](README.md#Columns) on how to use this

- Added support for setting Conditional Access policy state during import. The default setting is to import Conditional Access policies with the same sate as they were exported.
  This is based on feature request [Issue 25](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/25)
  Note: Security defaults must be disabled before Conditional Access policies can be imported as Enabled.

## 3.2.0 - 2021-08-15

**New features**

- Intune Tools (New View)

  - **ADMX Import** - Configure settings for 3rd party ADMX files with a UI similar to GPMC and create a Custom Profile based on the configured settings

  - **Reg Values** - Add registry values to HKLM or HKCU. This will create and ADMX based on the configured settings and create a Custom Profile in Intune

    See [ADMX Import](ADMXImport.md) for more information on how this works

    **Note:** There is only Import functionality in this version. It does not support updating an existing Custom Profile ADMX policies.
    
  - **Important!** Consider this tool to be in preview at this moment. It has only been tested on Cloud only joined devices. It looks like there are different functionality in the Policy CSP between hybrid and cloud only joined devices. 
    It would be great if anyone testing this on hybrid (or cloud only joined) devices could create an issue and report back the findings, even if it works as intended.

  There are indications that Microsoft is implementing this into the portal UI. The [groupPolicyUploadedDefinitionFile](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/resources/intune-grouppolicy-grouppolicyuploadeddefinitionfile?view=graph-rest-beta) API suggests that the portal will support this in the future. It would be good if this could be integrated with the Settings Catalog.

- Documentation:

  - Create cover page and table of contents when no template is selected
  - Select CSV delimiter when documenting to a CSV file

- Compare:

  - Select CSV delimiter for bulk compare

**Fixes**

* Authentication

  * The script will start even if it failed to add type TokenCacheHelperEx. 

    This is based on [Issue 21](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/21)

    **Note:** The token will not support caching if this fails. This could be caused by not having write access to the \CS folder or by restrictive ASR policies

* Export/Import

  * Added support for exporting OMA-URI values that are stored encrypted. 

    **Note:** OMA-URI strings and XML Files are stored encrypted. These values will be decrypted and stored in clear text. Be careful if sensitive data is stored e.g. passwords. 

  * Fix for updating existing Autopilot profiles during import. A new property was added that broke the functionality.
    This is based on the feature request in [Issue 17](https://github.com/Micke-K/IntuneManagement/issues/17)

* Documentation

  * New handling of Not Configured properties. Skipping unconfigured properties will now skip all these properties during documentation 
  * Minor fixes to avoid duplicate documentation of properties
