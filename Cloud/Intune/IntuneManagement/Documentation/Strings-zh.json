For example, schools have devices that are typically used by many students. With this setting, the school Intune administrator can turn on the Shared PC feature to allow one user at a time. Students can't switch between different signed-in accounts on the device. When the student signs out, you also choose to remove all user-specific settings. End users can sign in to these shared devices with a guest account. After users sign in, the credentials are cached. As they use the device, end-users only get access to features you allow. For example, you choose when the device goes in to sleep mode, if users can see and save files locally, enable or disable power management settings, and more. You also control if the guest account deletes when the user signs-off, or delete inactive accounts when a threshold is reached.",

If you don't create a domain join profile, these devices might fail to deploy.",

Windows 10/11 S mode is designed for security and performance. You can use Intune to switch out of S mode. Switching out of S mode is one way. And once you switch out of S mode, you can't go back to Windows 10/11 S mode. This feature applies to: Windows 10 and later, Windows 10 1809 or later for S mode and Windows Holographic for Business. These features are available in Intune, and are configurable by the administrator. Intune uses configuration profiles to create and customize these settings for your organization's needs. After you add these features in a profile, you can then push or deploy the profile to devices running Windows 10 or later in your organization. When you deploy the profile, Intune automatically upgrades the devices or switches out of S mode.",
